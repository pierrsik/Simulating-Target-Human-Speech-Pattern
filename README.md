# Simulating-Target-Human-Speech-Pattern
This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for simulating a target individual's communication style using large language models and advanced speech technologies. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate contextually accurate and personalized responses based on a person's prior speech data.
